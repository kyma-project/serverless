          A simple code snippet that you can run without provisioning or managing servers.
          It implements the exact business logic you define.
          A Function is based on the Function custom resource (CR) and can be written in either Node.js or Python.
          A Function can perform a business logic of its own. You can also bind it to an instance of a service
          and configure it to be triggered whenever it receives a particular event type from the service
          or a call is made to the service's API.
          Functions are executed only if they are triggered by an event or an API call.
