# Function Operator

The Function Operator is a Kubernetes controller that install Serverless.

make install-operator-k3d
```

This target:

- builds local image with `serverless-operator`
- tags local the `serverless-operator` image with its hash to be sure the deployment is updated
- uploads local image to k3d
- updates the image in the `serverless-operator` deployment
