# Serverless Architecture Updates

## Changes

- The internal Docker Registry is no longer part of the Serverless module. Instead, the Docker Registry is now a separate, standalone module.
- There is no longer a build job for Functions. Instead, a base image is used, which mounts the required dependencies dynamically.
- Libraries and dependencies are downloaded at the start of the Function's execution. This means that each replica of the Function can potentially use a different version of the dependencies.
- Function code is now injected directly into the runtime Pod, eliminating the need for pre-built images.

## Benefits

- **Simplified architecture**: By separating the Docker Registry into its own module, the Serverless module is now more lightweight and easier to manage.
- **Faster deployment**: The removal of the build job reduces the time required to deploy Functions.
- **Dynamic dependency resolution**: Dependencies are resolved at runtime, allowing for more flexibility in managing library versions.
- **Improved flexibility**: Injecting Function code into the runtime Pod simplifies the deployment process and reduces image management overhead.

## What should you know?

- **Avoid using `latest` versions of dependencies**: Since dependencies are downloaded at runtime, using `latest` versions can lead to inconsistencies between replicas. Always specify exact versions of dependencies to ensure stability and predictability.
- **Dependency resolution behavior**: Be aware that each replica of a Function may resolve and use a different version of a dependency if the version is not explicitly pinned.
